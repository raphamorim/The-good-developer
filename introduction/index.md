## Introduction

A few years ago I started working with development, specifically for web. So everything I do and see was very beautiful or awesome. I was a rookie. I knew nothing about what was right and wrong in the code. I was just studying and developing things. No worry about anything.

With time, I was learning more and more working on open source. And at some time I realized how differentiate good and bad code. Then I improved my logic, algorithms, reduce my code size. But over time I realized that none of that matters. This is not what makes the code in a good code, neither me a better programmer.

I started studying standards and the best practices for development.

The result was the best. I started to preach to the best standards, practices, techniques. Lectured at events, classes, workshops at work. So I decided to keep all this knowledge acquired in this book are you reading right now.

**But what I mean anyway?**


How many times have you had problems with other people's code?
